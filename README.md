Good for the community.



## Notes
- A global currency would not be deflationary built-in by default. It would not delete any coins. There would be natural deflation as more people use the coin.
- Maybe can't have simultaneous global currency and universal basic income because there would be no good way to share between all people because can't trust people/countries.
- There would need to be account identities for individuals and businesses. This way, some coins could have "expiration dates" so that they have be spent at businesses.
    - Expirations are removed once transferred to a business account. Expirations are used to stimulate the economy or a certain part of the economy.
    - Some coins could have added restrictions for types of businesses?
    - Need to have a really good app to show this info clearly.
    - Expired coins go back to the community
    - Taxes could be automatic for businesses? Meh. Though, at least some small tax should be taken out for stimulus/expiring coins
- Each KYC individual would get some expiring coins each year. A small start for UBI, which slowly grows each year
- Expiring coins are automatically used first when making payments
- How to handle accessibility?
- Maybe 0.1% of all transactions go to a community pot that is distributed equally each year. Though, it shouldn't be at the same time for everybody because that could introduce inflation with everybody suddenly having more money (aka, sudden demand increase). It would be slowly/equally distributed throughout the year.
    - Should payouts be calculated over the year or just over the month or just over the week? It could be nice to know exactly what the 12 months would bring in. Do the pros outweigh the cons for a weekly payout? Though, the weekly payout would likely be best for UBI/groceries and weekend activities. But, don't really want there to be higher prices each weekend. So, fortnightly or monthly would be better. And, people who depend on it would have to manage it better. Or, perhaps each person gets to decide themselves what their payout period is. Meh. Don't want to introduce that complication. This should be as simple as possible for distribution, for example, the first of every month. Businesses might have higher prices that first weekend, but could be lower after that.
    - Would it be too much complexity to have monthly payouts, but divided over different days/weeks? For example, half get payouts on the 1st and half get payouts on the 8th. Don't really want to do over 4 weeks because people have to wait significantly longer. But, perhaps 3 times every few days (1st, 4th, 7th). Don't really want more than that because people would be checking a lot and be disappointed. Another way to explain the reasoning for this is to keep a more stable infrastructure and not overwhelming it. It would be distributed throughout the day, nobody knowing when exactly they would receive the payout on the day.
- Maybe 0.2% of all transactions for community/government?
- Maybe 0.01% for miners? Tips are separate, if enabled
- Maybe 0.01% for stakers? 'Stakers' could be equivalent to savings accounts.
- Some goods have higher taxes. No other taxes?
